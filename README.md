# react-seed-simplify

We provide a running react project which is ready to be deployed across different environments. You don't need to worry about webpack configurations, linter, and some advanced features that are helpful both in development and in production, such as hot module replacement, tree shaking, code splitting, lazy loading, and code inspection.
